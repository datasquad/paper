## How to introduce
Before doing anything we want students to have installed the software required. Guidance is available from here: http://gcapes.github.io/git-course/

Once this has been done we can have a physical session (check with Gerard Capes whether he will be happy to gove such a section).

Jones (2019) conducted some studies in this area of work.
